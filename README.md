# Daily Planner Webapp
Daily planner application that runs in the browser powered by Moment.js

## Description
This is a simple webapp that allows the user to log their events and activities for the day into the interface and save each task. The page will save them to local storage so the tasks are kept between page visits.

### My User Story:
```
Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Persist events between refreshes of a page.
```

### Features:
- Dynamically generated page.
- Highlights current time of day in Orange, past events in grey and future events in green
- Saves content to localstorage for persistance.
- Times can be customized by changing start and end times in the js file.
